      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Abee’s Candles was founded with a mission to bring light, meaning, and beauty into everyday life.
        What began as a small creative project has grown into a space where tradition and artistry meet.
        We are inspired by the timeless symbolism of the flame — a reminder of hope, guidance, and presence —
        and we strive to carry that symbolism into each piece we create.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey is rooted in respect for heritage and a desire to share something that feels both sacred and personal.
        Every candle is made with care, patience, and intention, so that it can serve not only as a source of light,
        but also as a companion in moments of reflection, prayer, and peace.
      </p>

    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>
        At Abee’s Candles, we believe in respect, creativity, and devotion.
        These values guide everything we do — from the way we design and craft our candles to the way we connect with our community.
        We see our work as more than a craft; it is a way of sharing light and meaning with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to creating products that inspire reflection, gratitude, and serenity.
        Our candles are not just objects, but symbols of faith and tradition, designed to bring peace into everyday life.
        Whether placed in a home, given as a gift, or used in a moment of quiet devotion,
        they are meant to carry significance beyond their form.
      </p>

    <section class="intro">
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to continue building a brand that honors tradition while embracing modern design.
        We want every customer to feel that they are part of something meaningful when they choose Abee’s Candles.
        It is about more than a purchase — it is about joining a tradition of light, carrying forward a symbol that has guided and uplifted people for centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, we envision Abee’s Candles as a beacon of light and meaning in a busy world.
        We aim to continue crafting candles that not only illuminate spaces but also hearts and minds.
        Through our work, we hope to foster a deeper appreciation for the simple yet profound act of lighting a candle —
        a gesture that transcends time and culture, bringing people together in shared moments of peace and reflection.
